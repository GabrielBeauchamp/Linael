EVER.\r\n> Seriously, you **don't** really want your bot to quit for adding/correcting a functionnality.\r\n\r\n* It's shipped with a DSL to make module writting easy.\r\n> Just tell your bot what you want to do. Do not ask yourself how to.\r\n\r\n* It come with an ever-growing library of modules.\r\n> You want to create, not to rewrite the same old administration module, don't you?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n##What is not Linael (and why not Cinch)\r\n\r\nIt's not a gem. You can't add it to an other program this easily. And it is a bit heavier to clone the whole directory.\r\n\r\nIt's not only a framework to build features. \r\nIt's a whole bot with embeded features.\r\nI really like to have a whole DSL instead of some helper methods.\r\n\r\n#How to launch it?\r\n\r\n* Have ruby 1.9\r\n* Create your own file in bin (see [How to make launch config](https://github.com/Skizzk/Linael/wiki/How-to-make-launch-config))\r\n* Install dependencies\r\n```\r\nbundle install\r\n```\r\n* Launch it! \r\n```\r\nruby bin/your_own_linael\r\n```\r\n\r\n#How to add my own features?\r\n\r\nRead [How to make a new Module](https://github.com/Skizzk/Linael/wiki/How-to-make-a-new-Module)\r\n\r\n#How contribute?\r\n\r\n- Fork the develop branch. \r\n- Do it!\r\n- Submit a pull request.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
